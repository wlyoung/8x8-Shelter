# 8x8 Shelter 2.0

## About
Creating a smaller Shelter 2.0 design

Although earlier versions of the 8x8 Shelter  have been fabricated, a complete structure hasn't been built from these final files yet so there could be problems. Consider yourselves warned.


## Changes and issues

* The 8x8 Shelter uses 12 sheets of 1/2" material, 3 sheets of 3/4". 

* Everything is cut with a 1/4" bit

* The files are somewhat material agnostic, and can be made from material that's close to the designed size

* The half-lap connections in the rib parts have been replaced with bolted splice plates. They are both easier to assemble and much faster to cut

* The longitudinal slotted stringers that connect the ribs have been replaced with purlins that are fastened with screws into small plywood "wedges" that are cut from some of the 1/2" sheets. This allows the ribs to be narrower, giving more interior room. The use of these wedges allow us to fasten into the face of plywood instead of the edge, a much stronger connection.

* Shallow dimples (on their own layer in the files) mark the location of pilot holes for the screws. You can se these dimples to drill through holes with a hand drill and a bit sized for your crews, or toolpath tham as thru-holes and drill them with a seperate smaller bit
